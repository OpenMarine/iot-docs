Sending data through MQTT
#########################

Using an MQTT client like the OpenPlotter IoT app you can exchange data between your boat and other devices running other MQTT clients. You can find MQTT clients for Windows, Linux, Mac, OS and Android. All of them include tools to display and send data.

An MQTT broker is a server in charge of managing the traffic between MQTT clients. OpenPlotter IoT app also includes an MQTT broker to manage MQTT clients connected to its local network but if you want to connect to your boat from anywhere you will need a remote MQTT broker.

OpenMarine MQTT Broker is a 24/7 server available in 2 versions, public and free or private and paid.
